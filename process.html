      The idea to explore / the idea of interest is - networks  - in light of

      // emergence //
      // an agents’ experience of being a network+ being part of a network 
      // the logics of value emerging from a networked reality.

      Which in a line comes down to - 
      
      The archetype of a network lends itself to very different systems - when predictable realities evmerge from such a system,

      //1// being in forests
      Understanding the meaning of the word ‘forest’ and my personal history with forests.
      
      Forests are ecosystems, just like social media sites are ecosystems on which many lives are desires and wishes are manifested, mates are scored and life is lived. 
      
      Forest is a physical space that has plants, animals, insects, microbes, fungi and trees in an ever changing relationship with each other. 
      
      How do we begin to see forests without visiting them? What are the rules of forests 
      Well one cannot. And there no rules or rights. Forests are open

      What would make this project successful?
      The network and field grows out of my authorial life and becomes something on its own.

      Like I said in the beginning, I want to live a life where I am able to  
      
      The two forests I really want to go to - 
      The forests on oregan that Ann Tsing talks about in her beautiful book ‘Mushroom at the end of the world’ 
      The old growth forests that seems like the hangout spot of the author of myceliauim running and suzzanne simmard. 
      Rainorests of amazon- of which I know nothing of. A lover and a friend went and spent half a year there. 
      
      3. Additionaly, I want to go to three forest areas in India- 
      the forests that will be cut down in Arunachal. 
      The mangrove forests of Goa - where I only want to go if I am able to convince Gayatri Kodial to show me them. I heard her speak about it in the portal interview with Vivek.
      Deep forests in Coorg that mr. Ponnana has agreed to take me. (Western ghats)
      The forest in
      
      
      Write to me if there is any forests you think should make it into the list and are not there.
     
     
      While living in a city, one is taken to many places as being part of a circle, group, family. Moving to Delhi temrorarily, I am trying to make sense of my experience. Today, when I am writing this, on the 29 Feb, things have gone very far in the pogrom. <br><br>
      When there was an attack on students in Jamia Milia Islamia university inside the Library, it was unbelievable. Yesterday they murdered people in their houses, and it is only mildly shocking. There is a feeling of inevitablity to it. Today someone said - 'we are yet to see the worse I think.' 

      I hope to share my process and the situation in the country right now. 

      Forests in the city are dotted with ruins, which means at some point this forest was the middle of activity. Temporally occupied moments.

      How do these connect with one another or do they not.
