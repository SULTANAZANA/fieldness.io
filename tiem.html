        The passing of time is neither slow nor fast in this quaren-time. In the beginning I thought it was slower than usual, but I was mistaken. It is largely eventless and so it feels warped.    
        <br><br>
        There seems to be no present moment. There  is   nothing    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    here    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    in   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   this  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   moment. These  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  time   &nbsp; &nbsp; particles   &nbsp; &nbsp;  are   slipping through  &nbsp; &nbsp; without   touching   me.   They have been slipping for a while. The present has not existed for a long time now. 
        <br><br>
        Perhaps  having  an  honest   memory   of  this  time  would  be   a   challenge. Even though I am working, eating, sleeping and waking, even seeing the sun on many morning's, I am not feeling anything anymore. I'm unable to occupy the present moment.

        Time is folded within everything - Occurrence of thought, light coming to us from the sun, possibility of sound- the propagation of waves. All percieveable things implicitly carry time. To have a thought is to experience the passage of time.

            In this text, there are thought experiments for you - the reader. And there are findings of my experiments with time and my mind. Before the lockdown I was always busy living-Observing other human and non human things and being entangled in other being's realities. I never had had such unbroken time of emptiness that facilitates self observation. I did not start out with the intention of observing myself. It just happened  - as you will see.  This text is also explores diverse and well documented ways of time is seen historically and scientificly. You can also, just for fun, explore the structure of language to see how it affects our perception of time - or our ontological view of it -as we go along.

       In her book - <i>Updating to remain the same </i>, Wendy Chun talks about 'Networked time'. 




       /// What is it about time and tiem in Fieldness? 
       Because in 'fieldness - the incident network' there is coming together of non-human time with human time and networked time. The future is presn in the present and affects it. and In the future we are in a feedback loop with the past. This future and past can be of the scale of an hour, an year or many years. There is something about it which is a sort of co-living across time.

       Obeservation is collective. How can we think about collective observation. What does it do?

       // when I imagine myself with you all, with minds reading these words, I am imagining a future where I will be with the others. With you all.  The desire so much is to ' be with the a lot or a few people, animals, trees..'. 'To be with others is special' because there is a collective observation. It makes oneself, the others and the enviourment more real.  
       
       i have understood in this time of isolation that everythign I want to do in my life is towards having manyscales of life around me. Touch is needed. Touching a mushroom is a visceral feeling, of touching a life. One touches gently and with anticipation. 
        I cannot 'see' at all if I am alone. I cannot see anyting and there is nothing to see. It feel like being suspended. I feel like an astronaut. So far away from everything.  

       Since we are talking about ' seeing collectivly', must also mention seeing the other is so different from seeing together and when that happens, that is what life is worth living for. I live this isolated present in the hope of holding hands, being together, making sound into the other's sound and existing together.
        I want to explode very very slowly, and that will be life. 
      
       It would be lucky to get a chance to explode. Not every tree gets the chance, not every plant lives, not every plant is able to have other plants around. And those stories are tragic, but they too, i understand now, live in the dreams of the bloom. Atleast I do, and suppose if it doesn't come, I will be sad and satisfied for as much of an explosion this life was. //

              Language is binary. WHich means that my mind presents the word 'implosion'. Its so predictable its almost pointless. This needn't even be there.
