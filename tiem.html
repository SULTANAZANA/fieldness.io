        You are here. You navigated the website and you have come inside a word called time. (#1 :: Imagine if clicking a word took us inside it, and that was the only way of language. To have words inside each other rather than all kept side by side.) <br><br>
        Anyway, you are inside time now. <br> (#2:: A question that arises here is what does it mean to be inside? What is inside? This question for time. // popups for a minute each )<br>
        



        There is time. The word 'time' has many meanings and many different usages. From the day-to-day 'what time is it ?' to ' For the time- being' to ' quantum time','space-time' and 'space-time fabric', 'circular time', 'non-linear time' 'networked time' 'global time' and many other times. This time Transmediale 2020 opened with the .. talking about 'black time' and 'non-linear time'. There are many way to think about time and to experience time. Quarentine has brought up these thoughts in every mind living through this scrambled days. <br><br>

        thinking about time is a great pass-time. And trying to feel time pass is also an interesting time-pass. And it can even border on being meditative and spiritual if one really gets into it!<br>

        There is clock-time which is homogenous, also called Newtonian time. Each second is the same length. But this is not experential time. To differentiate experential time i.e. time as experienced by a being from all other usages of time - Let's call it TIEM. 

        Our experience of time- the Human experience of time is not homogenous. Some moments become dense. At other times, time can pass very quickly. The thinking about the passing of time also consumes time.* 
        Memories can shift the perception of the length of time of certain events. 

        The experience of time by non-human agents like trees, mantises, tortoises, bats and bugs can also be evoked by TIEM. 

        what is the realtionship between the scale of TIEM and the scale of TIME?


        *(One can easily get lost in these words if one doesn't move very quickly from one sentence to the other. Phrases like 'consuming time' and 'moving quikly' can hold one down if one reads too closely).  

         
        There used to be a time when one could say 'It's 5:15 in <i> my</i> watch' or 'this watch is fast or slow.' There was a multitute of time-realities. Time was 'contestable'.<br>
        Now, <br> 
        Global time is PRESENT in the NOW. It pre-exists. 
       <br><br>
       Everything from this time has a global time stamp.
        Images clicked on the phone, in cameras, screenshots taken, steps walked, food ordered and so on.  There is <i>a</i> TIME, syncronized all over the planet. Exact and which offers no possibility of any other time to exist.  (The planet as we speak is in one giant timelapse.) //gif of rotating earth//
      
        <br><br>
        The local time, the global time, the present time and the organismic time all exist at the same time. <br><br>

        non-liear time. The presence of things everywher at once. And of somthings nowhere ever. But still existing.

       In the end, I would like to bring the quantum erasure experiment to the front. 

       In her book - <i>Updating to remain the same </i>, Wendy Chun talks about 'Networked time'.
