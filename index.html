<!--IF someone is actually here reading this by going into the github code for this webiste, welcome to 'behind the scenes'! I will try to keep you entertained ;--) written on 7th April 2020. A very unremarkable day where I did not really do anything. One of the quarentine days where I did not do much at all. But this is irrelevant to you - the reader. it is interesting and strange to be talking to someone I cannot imagine, across a distance of space and time! Here is a secret- I think I am non-binary, but its not somethign I can really take on right now, and so I will continue to present as a woman. I am not a man though. For sure. I like to fuck women though. And oh! these days I have a very interesting secret crush. This is enough confession for one comment. see you later. maybe, maybe not. -->

     Fieldness is an experiment and research project to explore what is 'value'.  At the surface, Fieldness is a decentralized application or 'dapp'.  Underneath the surface, it is an archive of species that might never be seen again, an attempt to convert experiences with non-human beings into crypto-assets of inevitable and increasing rarity, a lifetime personal archive (for each user) of 'seeds' visited. It is about creating a model of 'what is valueable' from an organizing logic differnt from our current system.

   
     <br><br>
       Fieldness emerged out of my interest in mycelium and non human netowrks, blockchain tech and the distributed web as human network and in being a space for what lies in the <button onclick="myFunction()">extranodal</button>, extraterrestrial, extra-real spaces. This work is primarily about the act of observation.

        The Fieldness dapp is a platform for exploring this extra nodal space, the space in between destinations. It can be thought of as a game on top of a crowd sourced ecological database and uses tokens as 'seeds' which are time stamped and geo stamped and hold a quantum of information.

      <font color="yellow"> 
        By downloading the dapp, anyone can become part of the Fieldness Network. 
        An 'seed' in this context is any physical space with the proliferation of non-human activity or just simply presence of a predominantly non-human being.
        This means that a tree can be an incident. And one can earn money by sitting under a tree for a certain time.
        Mediated through the smartphone to access virtual and physical infrastructures of the city, this project attempts to create a parallel economy that is not based on consumption but on spending time in nature and observing. In this attention economy, we can barter a quantum of attention for a value and reinvent the meaning of ‘value’ in the process.

    <div id="why">
      <font color="yellow"> 
	  The artistic motivation is to create a moist envoirmint for a growing, living network that is also an ecological database and a repositary for a long time to come. It is an attempt to not forget what we are losing everyday with the ongoing mass exteinction events in all of our vicinities.  It is an experiment with the meaning of 'value' both in economic and philosophical space. It attempts to look at how value emerges or is enforced.
	 
	  In the world as we know it right now, what is valueable is constantly shifting. The economic models of what is valueable and exchangeable are in flux. Attention and value seem to have a close relation in our mediated lives right now. 
    With looming climate change, the pandemic, it seems imperetive to examine what has value. And i would like to ask people to join in the experiment to create a community and network supporting knowledge systems that have vanished from our mental models and vocabulary, public discourse and education. How to take back the earth?

        The Fieldness dapp* allows you to create 'seeds'. 
        These seeds contain in them location markers that are created by human on walks. Being a part of this network allows the users to earn cryptocurrency. 
        <br>
        The idea is that humans all over the world, taking walks, making observations add these unique observations to an open database that is not server or service dependent and can be trusted to run forever. *(forever is as long as the ethereum blockchain runs)
        
        You can create a new seed after you have some game-coins. You can earn game-coins by gathering them around other seeds lying around in your vicinity. These seeds are created by other users of the dapp. These fixed location markers gain or lose value with time as more or less visitors visit them. One could self sustain a seed if the creator visits it.  As you understand the dapp's meanign and function, you qualify to make your own seeds.

            Fieldness started as the incident network project.  
            The scope of the project to explore ways of seeing the planet- the popular mental models of what is 'valueable' on the planet and in our lives.  
           <br>
            It challenges the	notions of ownership - the ownersip of stocks, original artowrk,  stake in a complany, stake in the health of a network etc. what does it mean to share? what does it mean to own? 

            <br><br>
            Right now seems to be an appropriate time for this as we are going through a large shift in what in what we imagine as currency, what is valueable in the neolibral framework, and what value is reflected (or not reflected) in our lived reality. <br><br>
            
            Decentralized systems seem to be addressing some of the data exptractivist practices of centralized platforms like amazon, facebook etc. The financial model of web2.0 is attention extraction model.

    THE GAME DEV INTRO
This is a real cost- to commit a bit of data to the blockchain. It has a gas price- the price to run that bit of code. 
	  
	 And this is also you asset that you are creaing - investing in. Your observation in the real world - a microscopic superorganism, a strange plant or growth in places that can be visited by other people preferably. (you could make it in private property but it wouldn't gain value with no visitors lending their attention and observation to the seed. )

      //How to grow an idea // <br>
      this project can be imagined by employing the metaphor of a growing mushroom network. <br><br>
      //spore001// <br>
      The idea spawns from a mind drawing from various sources. Once an idea is formed - imagine it as a ball - this ball is a spore. It is no more rhizomatic. It was formed from a rhizomatic structure and carries within it the possibility of <i> becoming rhizome</i> again. This is the beginning. The idea is formed and is carried inside the landscape of a mind. It comes out <a href="https://sultanazana.github.io/5millionnet.github.io/"> here </a> as a proposal. All information translated into text and image uploaded onto virtual winds.
      <br><br>
      //landing of the spore//<br>
      Enviormental factors are defining to life or death of an organism. To its good luck, the spore landed on moist minds. It took root. This was a small step for the spore with possibility of profound transformation. 
      <br><br>
      //growing underground//<br>
      
      Moist minds opened a source for the spore to drink from. It starts to prepare. It settles into the moist surface and is becoming rhizome again, hidden away. It must find nutrition and love and grow its mycelial roots far and wide. And prepare to fruit. It has to study the landscape and the nature of virtual winds. Test the waters. This is its only chance to life, only chance to survive extinction.  <br>
      The source is limited and so is time. There will be a short youth - the celebration of life - becoming itself - becomgin mushroom - just after which - there will be decay. The spore would have lived its life.  It is ready to go into full bloom now. 
       
      <br><br>
      //becoming mushroom//
      <br>
      The spore has transformed into a mushroom. This webpage and the Fieldness app IS the mushroom. It contains within it the code to tranform any smartphone device into a portal, and any mind into a moist mind, creating a human social network. The time is ripe. The mushroom is ripe. 
      
      <br><br>
      // explode//
      <br>
      Once all the code is written and tested, films rendered, texts edited, webpages created and hosted, forest walks curated, cryptocurrency wallets checked-  the preperation is complete. The mushroom explodes. slowly. 
      An infinite number of spores spread. Travel with virtual winds into instagram feeds and twitter timelines. Hoping to take root in moist minds and cover the city of Delhi. <br>
       The first step is for a human to see Fieldness and not know what it is. The next step is to allow the spore to rest in their phone and their mind. The third step is to join the network and go on walks into forests. where is all this leading up to? What really is the intention of spore001? All of this work, the entire life of spore001 lead to this point. Humans walking inside a forest. what is the meaning of all this?

      <br><br>
      The initial spore001 sees its flourshing progeny and human faces staring into the above question and smiles. It has come a long way. The residues and impressions will be found in physical enviorments and movements of people long after its gone, it hopes. The answer to the above questions is also hidden somewhere in this page. 

       <!-- Inside a forest somewhere, a long time ago, there was a thought and a desire. if humans were to walk inside a forest- will they see what is before them?      How did Spore001 come into existence? There is a mystical force driving everything. what else could it be? -->
       <!-- There is a secret treasure, not the crypto treasure, but real treasure. How did Spore001 come into existence? there is a mystical force driving everything. what else could it be?  -->
