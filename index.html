A very unremarkable day where I did not really do anything. One of the quarentine days where I did not do much at all. But this is irrelevant to you - the reader. it is interesting and strange to be talking to someone I cannot imagine, across a distance of space and time! Here is a secret- I think I am non-binary, but its not somethign I can really take on right now, and so I will continue to present as a woman. I am not a man though. For sure. I like to fuck women though. And oh! these days I have a very interesting secret crush. This is enough confession for one comment. see you later. maybe, maybe not. -->

	   Fieldness is a artistic research project and a decentralized application or 'dapp'. It attempts to be an ecological network and a crowd sourced database hosted on Ethereum. Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications.

	  The artistic motivation is to create a moist envoirmint for a growing, living network that is also an ecological database for ourselves and a repositary for a long time to come. It is an attempt to not foret what we are losing everyday with the ongoing mass exteinction events in all of our vicinities.  It is an experiment with the meaning of 'value' both in economic and philosophical space. It attempts to look at how value emerges or is enforced.
	 
	  In the world as we know it right now, what is valueable is constantly shifting and is in no way universal. The economic models of what is valueable and exchangeable are in flux. Attention and value seem to have a close relation in our mediated lives right now. 
	  With looming climate change, the pandemic, it seems imperetive to examine what has value. And i would like to ask people to join in the experiment to create a community and network supporting old knowledge systems that have vanished from our vocabulary, public discourse and education. How to take back the earth?

	 Its about taking a walk in the wilderness. Its about shifting your attention away. <br><br>
	  
	 <br><br>
	 

	 Right now seems to be an appropriate time for this becuase of mainly two reasons. We are going through a large shift in what in what currency means and what are models of distribution of power. Decentralized systems seem to be addressing some of the data exptractivist practices of all the centralized platforms like amazon, facebook etc. The financial model of web2.0 is attention extraction model.

THE GAME DEV INTRO
This is a real cost- to commit a bit of data to the blockchain. It has a gas price- the price to run that bit of code. 
	  
	 And this is also you asset that you are creaing - investing in. Your observation in the real world - a microscopic superorganism, a strange plant or growth in places that can be visited by other people preferably. (you could make it in private property but it wouldn't gain value with no visitors lending their attention and observation to the seed. )
	  
 
	  -->
	  <br><br><br>
	  The fieldness dapp<br> 
	  The Fieldness dapp* allows you to create 'seeds'. 
	  These seeds contain in them location markers that are created by human on walks. Being a part of this network allows the users to earn cryptocurrency. 
	  <br>
	  The idea is that humans all over the world, taking walks, making observations add these unique observations to an open database that is not server or service dependent and can be trusted to run forever. *(forever is as long as the ethereum blockchain runs)
	  
	  You can create a new seed after you have some game-coins. You can earn game-coins by gathering them around other seeds lying around in your vicinity. These seeds are created by other users of the dapp. These fixed location markers gain or lose value with time as more or less visitors visit them. One could self sustain a seed if the creator visits it.  As you understand the dapp's meanign and function, you qualify to make your own seeds.

	  Now coming to what these seeds really are.

          An 'Incident' in this context is any physical space with the proliferation of non-human activity or just simply presence of a predominantly non-human being.
          This means that a tree can be an incident. And one can earn money by sitting under a tree for a certain time.
          Mediated through the smartphone to access virtual and physical infrastructures of the city, this project attempts to create a parallel economy that is not based on consumption but on spending time in nature and observing. In this attention economy, we can barter a quantum of attention for a value and reinvent the meaning of ‘value’ in the process.  " > what is it exactly?

      The world can be seen as many systems. Human bodies are systems; ecologies, factories, cities, and internet are all systems. <br> In physics, a system is a portion of the universe that has been chosen for studying the changes that take place within it in response to varying conditions. A system may be complex, such as a planet, or relatively simple, as the liquid within a glass. 
      <br><br>
      Systems can be seen from various lenses - they can be seen for the materials they are made up of, for the function they serve, for the relationships different agents in a system have with each other and so on. <br> <br>
      Here we are looking at systems from the lens of networks.* 
      
      *It isn;t possible to look at anytign without a lens. Our senses, abstract conepts, physical instruments, mathematical equations - are all lenses for looking at a system. <br>
      If we look at something, we must also look at the lens. Observing the process of observation is necessary to draw insights from the observation. <br><br>

      And so we will use this archetype (of a network) to explore experential time, umwelts, 
      emergence of value and relationships inside systems like non human networks on forest floors and human networks like the interweb.

      //How to grow an idea // <br>
      this project can be imagined by employing the metaphor of a growing mushroom network. <br><br>
      //spore001// <br>
      The idea spawns from a mind drawing from various sources. Once an idea is formed - imagine it as a ball - this ball is a spore. It is no more rhizomatic. It was formed from a rhizomatic structure and carries within it the possibility of <i> becoming rhizome</i> again. This is the beginning. The idea is formed and is carried inside the landscape of a mind. It comes out <a href="https://sultanazana.github.io/5millionnet.github.io/"> here </a> as a proposal. All information translated into text and image uploaded onto virtual winds.
      <br><br>
      //landing of the spore//<br>
      Enviormental factors are defining to life or death of an organism. To its good luck, the spore landed on moist minds. It took root. This was a small step for the spore with possibility of profound transformation. 
      <br><br>
      //growing underground//<br>
      
      Moist minds opened a source for the spore to drink from. It starts to prepare. It settles into the moist surface and is becoming rhizome again, hidden away. It must find nutrition and love and grow its mycelial roots far and wide. And prepare to fruit. It has to study the landscape and the nature of virtual winds. Test the waters. This is its only chance to life, only chance to survive extinction.  <br>
      The source is limited and so is time. There will be a short youth - the celebration of life - becoming itself - becomgin mushroom - just after which - there will be decay. The spore would have lived its life.  It is ready to go into full bloom now. 
       
      <br><br>
      //becoming mushroom//
      <br>
      The spore has transformed into a mushroom. This webpage and the Fieldness app IS the mushroom. It contains within it the code to tranform any smartphone device into a portal, and any mind into a moist mind, creating a human social network. The time is ripe. The mushroom is ripe. 
      
      <br><br>
      // explode//
      <br>
      Once all the code is written and tested, films rendered, texts edited, webpages created and hosted, forest walks curated, cryptocurrency wallets checked-  the preperation is complete. The mushroom explodes. slowly. 
      An infinite number of spores spread. Travel with virtual winds into instagram feeds and twitter timelines. Hoping to take root in moist minds and cover the city of Delhi. <br>
       The first step is for a human to see Fieldness and not know what it is. The next step is to allow the spore to rest in their phone and their mind. The third step is to join the network and go on walks into forests. where is all this leading up to? What really is the intention of spore001? All of this work, the entire life of spore001 lead to this point. Humans walking inside a forest. what is the meaning of all this?

      <br><br>
      The initial spore001 sees its flourshing progeny and human faces staring into the above question and smiles. It has come a long way. The residues and impressions will be found in physical enviorments and movements of people long after its gone, it hopes. The answer to the above questions is also hidden somewhere in this page. 

       <!-- Inside a forest somewhere, a long time ago, there was a thought and a desire. if humans were to walk inside a forest- will they see what is before them?      How did Spore001 come into existence? There is a mystical force driving everything. what else could it be? -->
       <!-- There is a secret treasure, not the crypto treasure, but real treasure. How did Spore001 come into existence? there is a mystical force driving everything. what else could it be?  -->
