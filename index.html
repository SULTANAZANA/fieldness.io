<!--IF someone is actually here reading this by going into the github code for this webiste, welcome to 'behind the scenes'! I will try to keep you entertained ;--) written on 7th April 2020. A very unremarkable day where I did not really do anything. One of the quarentine days where I did not do much at all. But this is irrelevant to you - the reader. it is interesting and strange to be talking to someone I cannot imagine, across a distance of space and time! Here is a secret- I think I am non-binary, but its not somethign I can really take on right now, and so I will continue to present as a woman. I am not a man though. For sure. I like to fuck women though. And oh! these days I have a very interesting secret crush. This is enough confession for one comment. see you later. maybe, maybe not. -->

	  Fieldness is an ecological network and platform that uses KONJ cryptocurrency. It is an active space and an archive. It is subject to global events like the covid-19 pandemic, cosmic events like solar flares, human and non human events like the sowing seasons, locust attacks, floods, electricity shortages, internet shutdowns and mushroom foraging seasons etc. 
	  
	  Any human or bot who has laid eyes on this website has left an impression here in the form of a circle. You are also a blob here. <br>
	  Now you are invited to become a part of this network by downloading the fieldness app on your phone. (It is an android app right now, we're trying to get an OS app soon as well). But with or whitout aspp, with or without phone, this is about a way of seeing the spaces we live in, to look towards ancient interlligence, alternate worlds with an alternative vocabulary. Fieldness is shifting your attention away. Away from the words on a screen. Look away. Blink a few times. <br><br>
	  
	  So take a walk in th wilderness or walk to the nearest circle that you can see on the map. If where you are, you are not in the majority and there are non human beings- like mushrooms, if you are standing in soil and not on concrete then you could mark this place as an 'incindnt'
	 
	  
	  
	  
	<br><br>  
        Fieldness is an artistic research project created to <i> observe </i> the amalgamated surfaces we live on.
        <br><br>
        Field-ness is imagined as a network of webpages and people connected across a mobile app in an attempt to create tremors in the neo-libral fabric.  <br> <a href="field.html">What is field?</a> <br><br>
        It is also an attempt to exist as a techno-human-algorithmic entity feedbacking with moist meme sources and non-human living beings,  to explore various human and non-human vicinities. 
        By being this entity perhaps one can begin to understand new logics of value that are emerging on this algamated surface. <br> 
        
          <a href="" title=" By downloading an app, anyone can become part of the Incident Network. Being a part of this network allows the users to earn  cryptocurrency by visiting incidents all across the city. Users can also register/frame their own incidents.
          An 'Incident' in this context is any physical space with the proliferation of non-human activity or just simply presence of a predominantly non-human being.
          This means that even a tree can be an incident. And one can earn money by sitting under a tree for a certain time.
          Mediated through the phone to access virtual and physical infrastructures of the city, this project attempts to create a parallel economy that is not based on consumption but on spending time in nature and observing. In this attention economy, we can barter a quantum of attention for a value and reinvent the meaning of ‘value’ in the process.  " > what is it exactly?

      The world can be seen as many systems. Human bodies are systems; ecologies, factories, cities, and internet are all systems. <br> In physics, a system is a portion of the universe that has been chosen for studying the changes that take place within it in response to varying conditions. A system may be complex, such as a planet, or relatively simple, as the liquid within a glass. 
      <br><br>
      Systems can be seen from various lenses - they can be seen for the materials they are made up of, for the function they serve, for the relationships different agents in a system have with each other and so on. <br> <br>
      Here we are looking at systems from the lens of networks.* 
      
      *It isn;t possible to look at anytign without a lens. Our senses, abstract conepts, physical instruments, mathematical equations - are all lenses for looking at a system. <br>
      If we look at something, we must also look at the lens. Observing the process of observation is necessary to draw insights from the observation. <br><br>

      And so we will use this archetype (of a network) to explore experential time, umwelts, 
      emergence of value and relationships inside systems like non human networks on forest floors and human networks like the interweb.

      //How to grow an idea // <br>
      this project can be imagined by employing the metaphor of a growing mushroom network. <br><br>
      //spore001// <br>
      The idea spawns from a mind drawing from various sources. Once an idea is formed - imagine it as a ball - this ball is a spore. It is no more rhizomatic. It was formed from a rhizomatic structure and carries within it the possibility of <i> becoming rhizome</i> again. This is the beginning. The idea is formed and is carried inside the landscape of a mind. It comes out <a href="https://sultanazana.github.io/5millionnet.github.io/"> here </a> as a proposal. All information translated into text and image uploaded onto virtual winds.
      <br><br>
      //landing of the spore//<br>
      Enviormental factors are defining to life or death of an organism. To its good luck, the spore landed on moist minds. It took root. This was a small step for the spore with possibility of profound transformation. 
      <br><br>
      //growing underground//<br>
      
      Moist minds opened a source for the spore to drink from. It starts to prepare. It settles into the moist surface and is becoming rhizome again, hidden away. It must find nutrition and love and grow its mycelial roots far and wide. And prepare to fruit. It has to study the landscape and the nature of virtual winds. Test the waters. This is its only chance to life, only chance to survive extinction.  <br>
      The source is limited and so is time. There will be a short youth - the celebration of life - becoming itself - becomgin mushroom - just after which - there will be decay. The spore would have lived its life.  It is ready to go into full bloom now. 
       
      <br><br>
      //becoming mushroom//
      <br>
      The spore has transformed into a mushroom. This webpage and the Fieldness app IS the mushroom. It contains within it the code to tranform any smartphone device into a portal, and any mind into a moist mind, creating a human social network. The time is ripe. The mushroom is ripe. 
      
      <br><br>
      // explode//
      <br>
      Once all the code is written and tested, films rendered, texts edited, webpages created and hosted, forest walks curated, cryptocurrency wallets checked-  the preperation is complete. The mushroom explodes. slowly. 
      An infinite number of spores spread. Travel with virtual winds into instagram feeds and twitter timelines. Hoping to take root in moist minds and cover the city of Delhi. <br>
       The first step is for a human to see Fieldness and not know what it is. The next step is to allow the spore to rest in their phone and their mind. The third step is to join the network and go on walks into forests. where is all this leading up to? What really is the intention of spore001? All of this work, the entire life of spore001 lead to this point. Humans walking inside a forest. what is the meaning of all this?

      <br><br>
      The initial spore001 sees its flourshing progeny and human faces staring into the above question and smiles. It has come a long way. The residues and impressions will be found in physical enviorments and movements of people long after its gone, it hopes. The answer to the above questions is also hidden somewhere in this page. 

       <!-- Inside a forest somewhere, a long time ago, there was a thought and a desire. if humans were to walk inside a forest- will they see what is before them?      How did Spore001 come into existence? There is a mystical force driving everything. what else could it be? -->
       <!-- There is a secret treasure, not the crypto treasure, but real treasure. How did Spore001 come into existence? there is a mystical force driving everything. what else could it be?  -->
